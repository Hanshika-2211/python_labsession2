# Python Tuple Programs Repository

This repository contains Python programs focusing on tuple-related operations. Each program serves as a practical example to enhance your understanding of tuple manipulation in Python.

## Program Descriptions:

### 1. **Add Tuple to List (p1.py):**
   - This program adds the elements of a tuple to an existing list. The list `a` initially contains `[1, 3, 5, 6]`, and the tuple `b` is `(67, 46, 78)`. The program extends the list with the elements of the tuple, resulting in an updated list.

### 2. **Size of Tuple using len() (p2.py):**
   - This program calculates the size of a tuple using the `len()` method. The tuple `input` is initialized with elements `(66, 77, 88, 'car', 'roy', 87.65)`. The program then prints the length of the tuple.

### 3. **List of Tuples with Number and Cube (p3.py):**
   - The program creates a list of tuples from a given list, where each tuple consists of a number and its cube. The list `c` is initially `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, and the program generates tuples containing the number and its cube for each element in the list.

*Feel free to explore, modify, and use these examples to reinforce your understanding of tuples in Python. Each program is well-commented to aid comprehension. Happy coding!*
